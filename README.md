# MyCourses

Live Project [here](https://mycoursess.netlify.app/)

The idea for this website came from my childhood. Back then, finding places to learn STEM subjects or languages in our country was quite a task.You had to go from one place to another, hoping they offered the courses you wanted. It was a hassel! though my mom would go each one of them and would enroll us to different courses :).

With this platform, anyone can share the courses they teach, making it easy for learners to discover them., whether its offline or online. Whether you're passionate about math, science, technology, or languages, you'll find something for you here. A place where teachers and learners can connect effortlessly. No more endless searching or missed opportunities. Just learning made simple."



### Backend

Backend API [here](https://mycourses-backend.onrender.com/) 

 The REST API has been created using json-server, which is a powerfull tool frontend developers use as mock REST API for developement and testing purposes, but works extaclty like REST API. The developer plans to learn Node.js and implement it in this project, but just not today. It will be added in the list of learnings :) One Step at a time ;)
/ Coming soon... /

**The backend will be slow, so have patience.**
